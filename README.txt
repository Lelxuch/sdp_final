Topic: Online tech shop
This is a project about an online tech store. The user can register, log in.
After which you can buy goods. There is a system of cashback, depending on
the method of payment. Products are divided into three categories: smartphones,
laptops, monitors. You can buy all these products by different colors. Each
color adds value to the product. The user can sign up for updates from the store.
He will be notified of new products or discounts. And you can check for these
updates in the mail. It is also possible to unsubscribe from updates. Let's move
on to the admin. He can add new products or make discounts on them. When
creating, you have to select a category, and then fill out a form to create
a device. To lower the price of the product, you need to select a category,
select the product itself, and then put the new price.
